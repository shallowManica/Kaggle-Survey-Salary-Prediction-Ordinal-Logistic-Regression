# Kaggle-Survey-Salary-Prediction-Ordinal-Logistic-Regression
This project builds an ML pipeline to predict Kaggle survey salary buckets. It includes missing value imputation, encoding (OneHot, ordinal, label), feature selection via RandomForestClassifier, and ordinal logistic regression (one-vs-rest) with GridSearchCV tuning, evaluated using accuracy and F1-score.
